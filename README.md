# SetIP
## Synopsis
SetIP is a utility for creating and managing profiles of IP configuration settings that can be applied to the local machine or shared.

## Code Example

## Motivation
This project is motivated by the situations I encounter everyday at work.  I normally travel to various customer locations and connect to their network, but DHCP is not normally enabled on these networks.  I have to spend time investigating the addressing scheme and tyring to find an open IP address.  The next time I go to the site it is very likely that I will have to repeat these steps.

Rather than spend time repeatedly investigating the same network on subsequent visits I thought it would be better to develop a utility that allows me to save the settings I come up with so that I can reuse them later.  Even better, if one of my colleagues goes to the site it would be nice to share a file with them that will properly set up their NIC and save them the investigation time.

## Installation
Coming eventually.  Right now there is no installation.

## API Reference
Coming eventually.  Single library at the moment.  Very little documentation.

## Tests
As terrible as it sounds, I have no formal tests written yet.  This will happen eventually, but I am getting some momentum first.  I will refactor and move to a more TDD process eventually.

## Contributors
None at the moment.

## License
MIT license.  It is my intention that this be a free and open utility.  This is mostly about the act of creating the software and the utility I seek out of it, not about profit.
